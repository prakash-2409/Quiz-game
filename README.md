⚙️ How It Works

User starts the quiz and answers one question at a time.

On each answer:

If correct → score increases & progress bar fills.

If wrong → move to next without progress increase.

At the end → final score is displayed.

Using event listeners for button clicks.

Implementing conditional logic in JavaScript.

Updating CSS dynamically via JavaScript (progress bar).

🔮 Future Enhancements

💾 Store results in localStorage to track past attempts.

🌐 Connect to a backend (MongoDB/Node.js) for dynamic questions.

🏆 Add leaderboard/score history.
